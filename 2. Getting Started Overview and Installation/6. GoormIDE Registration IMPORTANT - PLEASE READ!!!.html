<h4>Hello&nbsp;Everyone!&nbsp;</h4><p>Cloud9 was acquired by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and they closed down the legacy version of Cloud9 (c9.io), that I use in the lectures.<br><br>While you can sign up for the new AWS&nbsp;version of Cloud9, that is <em>not something that we recommend</em> as it requires a credit card to use the free trial and is not exactly beginner friendly.<br><br><strong>Instead, we now recommend using a different cloud based IDE called, GoormIDE.</strong><br>Goorm is a great IDE and is fairly similar to the legacy version of Cloud9 that I use in the video lectures.</p><p>Everything that I mentioned in the previous video, regarding the use of Cloud9, can also be applied to Goorm.<br><br>Our TA (Ian) has created a readme file that explains the signup and setup processes for Goorm.</p><h4><strong>Please go &gt;&gt;&gt; </strong><a href="https://gist.github.com/nax3t/2773378c4d1bada8d66d12f4d5210248" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><strong>here</strong></a><strong> &lt;&lt;&lt; to view signup and setup instructions.</strong></h4><p>Once you finish with the instructions, then you can continue with the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/learn/lecture/7048184#overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">next section</a> in the course.</p><p><strong><br>Need help?</strong> Feel free to post in the Q&amp;A or visit the <a href="https://discord.gg/jKEqCmG" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">#goorm-setup-help</a> channel in our community discord server.</p><p><br><strong>Please note</strong>, if you choose to install MySQL locally (explained in a later video), bear in mind that the <code>mysql-ctl</code> commands that I'll be using throughout the course do not apply to a local install of MySQL, they only work for GoormIDE.</p><p><br>Thanks, <br>Colt</p><p><br></p><p>P.S.
