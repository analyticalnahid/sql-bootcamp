<p>Hi Everyone!<br><br>In the previous lecture there was a slight discrepancy in the slides regarding the maximum size/value for the INT datatype. Please see&nbsp;<a href="https://www.udemy.com/the-ultimate-mysql-bootcamp-go-from-sql-beginner-to-expert/learn/v4/questions/3002798"  rel="nofollow">here</a> for a discussion with the correct information.</p>

<p>thanks,<br>Ian<br><em>Course TA</em></p>
