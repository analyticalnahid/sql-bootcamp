<p><strong><strong></strong></strong></p><p>Hi Everyone!<br><br>Step 4 from the next lecture will give you errors if you're using firefox or any other browser other than Chrome, Safari, or Opera. This is because the SQL Try-It Editor is using WebSQL which isn't compatible with all browsers.Â </p><p>We recommend using chrome for those exercises and for the remainder of the course, if possible.</p><p>Thanks,<br>Ian</p><p><strong><strong><br></strong></strong></p>
